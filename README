Howdy, do interns. So, you want to be serious programmer? We'll let's not waste time, and get right on it.

Instructions:

1) Create a github account.

2) Fork this repo.

3) Create a source code file, name it under your name. No spaces, no commas. If your name is Mark John Buenconsejo, name the file: markjohnbuenconsejo.rb. The file extension depends on the programming language of the source code you're attaching. Place the file in the root directory of this repo.

4) Paste the best code you have ever written in your life, in your source file. It can be past work, or code you've worked on in a school project or exam. In the source file, place some comments, and explain how it works, the design behind it.

Tip: If you haven't written anything at all, well i'm sorry, we are looking for programmers, not philosophers.

5) Commit and push your file to your forked repo.

6) Paste the link to your GitHub repo in the questionaire.
